<h2> Project description </h2>
<p> This project comes as a need for having personal web server at home for hosting web page. ESP8266 is a cheap Wi-Fi module that supports http and https protocols. ESP8266 controls communication with clients. Website is updated via HTTP request POST, and website is stored on external EEPROM because ESP8266 has only 4kB of internal EEPROM. This web server also sends statuses and notifications through serial port, so administrator can follow activities on server. This project should be revisited and adjusted for use with IoT platforms, to facilitate the publication of the content. </p>
